I prefer to seek PhD opportunity after my Master study. My research interests include robot perception, computer vision and autonomous system. You can email me at xiaotongli [at] tudelft [dot] nl.

Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
